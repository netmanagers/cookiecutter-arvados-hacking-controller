Welcome to your fresh Arvados installation of {{cookiecutter.cluster_uuid}}!

This is meant to be used with vscode and docker-compose.

Please install the extension Remote Container in VSCODE:: 

  ext install ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers

Then execute vscode in this directory

  code

you should be asked "Do you want to open workspace in a Container?"

After that, the first time Docker-compose will take some time to build all the images 
for arvados and then the new environment should be ready to go
